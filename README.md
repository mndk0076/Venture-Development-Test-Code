I used mamp pro for my local server, you can use any local server but change the right credentials in the config.php
Keep in mine that if you are not using mamp pro, you might need to change some paths in the models folder and the js - but I beleive it should be okay.

I added the database.sql in the file - I added the drop/added table statement so keep in mind if you have an existing database that is called database, it will get drop and replace with my sql.

Let me know if you need help running it :)
